# Disease-prediction-using-ML

In my machine learning project, I developed a robust system that predicts diseases based on input symptoms. By leveraging the power of ensemble learning, I combined the predictive abilities of four machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes.

The project utilized a comprehensive dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases, training the classifiers to recognize patterns and associations. The ensemble approach ensured that the predictions were more accurate and reliable by aggregating the outputs of multiple models.

Through this project, users can input their symptoms, and the system harnesses the collective intelligence of the ensemble classifiers to provide a disease prediction. This aids in early detection, efficient diagnosis, and appropriate medical intervention.

By incorporating multiple classifiers, the system takes advantage of their individual strengths and compensates for any weaknesses, resulting in a more robust and accurate prediction model. The project represents an effective application of machine learning techniques for disease prediction, contributing to advancements in the field of healthcare and improving patient outcomes.
